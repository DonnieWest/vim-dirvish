Opening Files and Directories~

    | Open in Current Window    | o      | po     |
    | Open in Horizontal Split  | s      | ps     |
    | Open in Vertical Split    | v      | pv     |

    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    * If multiple files are selected in visual mode, the
      action will be carried out on all visually-selected
      files. The action can also take an optional V[count],
      which specifies that the action will be carried out on
      the file listed at line V[count] of the Dirvish
      buffer, regardless of where the cursor is.

If there is a visual selection, all selected files will be targeted for the
action invoked by the key mapping. For example, if four files are selected,
then `v` opens the files in four vertical splits.

Alternatively, all key maps to open files or directory can take an optional
V[count], which specifies the file or directory to open in terms of the line
number in which it is listed. So, for example, while '`v`' will open the file
or directory currently listed at the current cursor line in a new vertical
split, '`42v`' will open the file or directory at line 42 in a new vertical
split, regardless of where the cursor is.

All actions can be carried in a "popout" by using the `p` prefix.
This means the action is carried out in the background: the files are
opened in splits or tabs as appropriate, but the Dirvish buffer maintains
focus.
