Opening Files and Directories~

    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    | Action*                   | Foreground | Background |
    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    | Open in Current Window    | o          | po         |
    | Open in Horizontal Split  | s          | ps         |
    | Open in Vertical Split    | v          | pv         |
    | Open in Tab Page          | t          | pt         |
    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    * If multiple files are selected in visual mode, the
      action will be carried out on all visually-selected
      files. The action can also take an optional V[count],
      which specifies that the action will be carried out on
      the file listed at line V[count] of the FileBeagle
      buffer, regardless of where the cursor is.

The basic set of key maps allow for the the opening of the file or directory
under the cursor, either in the current window or split, or a new horizontal
split, vertical split, or tab page.

If there is a visual selection active, then instead of the file currently
under the cursor, all selected files will be targeted for the action invoked
by the key mapping. For example, if there are four files highlighted in a
visual selection, then '`v`' will result in four vertical splits being
created, with each one of the selected files being opened in its own split.

Alternatively, all key maps to open files or directory can take an optional
V[count], which specifies the file or directory to open in terms of the line
number in which it is listed. So, for example, while '`v`' will open the file
or directory currently listed at the current cursor line in a new vertical
split, '`42v`' will open the file or directory at line 42 in a new vertical
split, regardless of where the cursor is.

All actions can be carried out with FileBeagle in a "pinned mode" by
initiating the key sequence with '`p`'. With FileBeagle in "pinned mode", the
action is carried out in the background: i.e., the files are opened with the
FileBeagle buffer remaining open and in focus. So, for example, '`pv`' will
open the file under the cursor in a new vertical split, while keeping the
FileBeagle buffer open and in focus. This can also be used with multiple files
visually-selected to open all of them in the background in new vertical
splits, or a V[count] to open a file/directory at a specific line.

<CR>
o               Open the file or directory under the cursor in the current
                window. Multiple files can be opened simultaneously by

                window.
p<CR>
po              Open the file or directory under the cursor in the current
                window in the background. Multiple files can be opened
                simultaneously by selecting them in visual mode.

                vertical split.


s               Open the currently selected file or directory in a new
                horizontal split. Multiple files can be opened simultaneously
                by selecting them in visual mode.

Reading/Inserting Files~

    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    | Action*                   | Foreground | Background |
    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    | Read/Insert Below Current | r.         | pr.        |
    | Read/Insert at Beginning  | r0         | pr0        |

    * If multiple files are selected in visual mode, the
      action will be carried out on all visually-selected
      files. The action can also take an optional V[count],
      which specifies that the action will be carried out on
      the file listed at line V[count] of the FileBeagle
      buffer, regardless of where the cursor is.

At the moment, only files can be read/inserted into the current (original)
buffer. As above, the basic key maps (`r.`, `r0`, `r$`, for insertion below
current cursor line, at beginning of file, or end of file, respectively) can
be modified by V[count] to target a file at a specific line V[count] in the
FileBeagle buffer or prefixed by `p` to "put" the file in a separate
tab/window/hidden buffer. In addition, again as above, if a visual selection
is active, the action will be carried out on all visually-selected files.


r.              Close FileBeagle and insert contents of the current or
                selected file(s) into original buffer at line below the
                current cursor position in the original buffer.

V[count]r.      Close FileBeagle and insert contents of the file at line
                V[count] into original buffer at line below the current cursor
                position in the original buffer.

pr.             Keep FileBeagle open and in focus, and insert contents of the
                current or selected file(s) into original buffer at line below
                the current cursor position in the original buffer.

V[count]pr.     Keep FileBeagle open and in focus, and insert contents of the
                file at line V[count] into original buffer at line below the
                current cursor position in the original buffer.

r0              Close FileBeagle and insert contents of the current or
                selected file(s) into original buffer at the beginning of the
                buffer.

V[count]r0      Close FileBeagle and insert contents of the file at line
                V[count] into original buffer at the beginning of the buffer.

pr0             Keep FileBeagle open and in focus, and insert contents of the
                current or selected file(s) into original buffer the beginning.

V[count]pr0     Keep FileBeagle open and in focus, and insert contents of the
                file at line V[count] into original buffer at the beginning of
                the buffer.

r$              Close FileBeagle and insert contents of the current or
                selected file(s) into original buffer at the end of the buffer.

V[count]r$      Close FileBeagle and insert contents of the file at line
                V[count] into original buffer at the end of the buffer.

pr$             Keep FileBeagle open and in focus, and insert contents of the
                current or selected file(s) into original buffer at the end of
                the buffer.

V[count]pr$     Keep FileBeagle open and in focus, and insert contents of the
                file at line V[count] into original buffer at the end of the
                buffer.

OPTIONS AND SETTINGS~

The file patterns to ignore can be controlled via |wildignore|.

More options:

g:filebeagle_hijack_netrw~                          *g:filebeagle_hijack_netrw*
    Default: 1
    If specified as 0, directories will be opened by |netrw| instead of
    FileBeagle.

g:filebeagle_show_hidden~                            *g:filebeagle_show_hidden*
    Default: 0
    Show hidden and (wild-)ignored files by default (can be toggled when
    viewing a directory using 'gh').

g:filebeagle_show_line_numbers~                *g:filebeagle_show_line_numbers*
    Default: -1
    If 0, then line numbers (see |nu|) will be suppressed in the directory
    buffer (i.e, 'set nonumber' will be invoked). If 1, then line numbers will
    be explicitly activated (i.e, 'set number' will be invoked). If -1
    (default), then no number options will be explicitly set or unset.

g:filebeagle_show_line_relativenumbers~ *g:filebeagle_show_line_relativenumbers*
    Default: -1
    If 0, then relative line numbers (see |rnu|) will be suppressed in the
    directory buffer (i.e, 'set rnu' will be invoked). If 1, then relative
    line numbers will be explicitly activated (i.e, 'set nornu' will be
    invoked). If -1 (default), then no relative number options will be
    explicitly set or unset.
