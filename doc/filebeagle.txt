Opening Files and Directories~

    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    | Action*                   | Foreground | Background |
    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    | Open in Current Window    | o          | po         |
    | Open in Horizontal Split  | s          | ps         |
    | Open in Vertical Split    | v          | pv         |
    | Open in Tab Page          | t          | pt         |
    +---------------------------+------------+------------+
    * If multiple files are selected in visual mode, the
      action will be carried out on all visually-selected
      files. The action can also take an optional V[count],
      which specifies that the action will be carried out on
      the file listed at line V[count] of the FileBeagle
      buffer, regardless of where the cursor is.

The basic set of key maps allow for the the opening of the file or directory
under the cursor, either in the current window or split, or a new horizontal
split, vertical split, or tab page.

If there is a visual selection active, then instead of the file currently
under the cursor, all selected files will be targeted for the action invoked
by the key mapping. For example, if there are four files highlighted in a
visual selection, then '`v`' will result in four vertical splits being
created, with each one of the selected files being opened in its own split.

Alternatively, all key maps to open files or directory can take an optional
V[count], which specifies the file or directory to open in terms of the line
number in which it is listed. So, for example, while '`v`' will open the file
or directory currently listed at the current cursor line in a new vertical
split, '`42v`' will open the file or directory at line 42 in a new vertical
split, regardless of where the cursor is.

All actions can be carried out with FileBeagle in a "pinned mode" by
initiating the key sequence with '`p`'. With FileBeagle in "pinned mode", the
action is carried out in the background: i.e., the files are opened with the
FileBeagle buffer remaining open and in focus. So, for example, '`pv`' will
open the file under the cursor in a new vertical split, while keeping the
FileBeagle buffer open and in focus. This can also be used with multiple files
visually-selected to open all of them in the background in new vertical
splits, or a V[count] to open a file/directory at a specific line.

<CR>
o               Open the file or directory under the cursor in the current

po              Open the file or directory under the cursor in the current
                window in the background. Multiple files can be opened
                simultaneously by selecting them in visual mode.
V[count]p<CR>

v               Open the currently selected file or directory in a new

                vertical split.


s               Open the currently selected file or directory in a new
                horizontal split. Multiple files can be opened simultaneously
                by selecting them in visual mode.
V[count]s        Open the file or directory at line V[count] in a new horizontal
                split.

ps              Open the file or directory under the cursor in a new

                split in the background.


t               Open the currently selected file in a new tab. Multiple files
                can be opened simultaneously by selecting them in visual mode.

                by selecting them in visual mode.

V[count]pt      Open the file or directory at line V[count] in a new tab in
                the background.
